# PROFILE: docker (used when running via docker-compose)
#   In Compose, services resolve each other by service name. The VNFM container
#   is named "vnfm" in docker-compose.yml, so we use http://vnfm:8080 (container
#   internal port). Compose's built-in DNS resolves "vnfm" to the container IP.
#   Same concept as K8s Service Discovery—logical name, no hardcoded IP.

vnfm.service.url=http://vnfm:8080
